# Mobile Navigation Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Hamburger Menu Color Issue**
- **Problem**: The hamburger menu icon was set to `color: white` in the hero section, but the navbar has a white/translucent background, making it invisible.
- **Fixed in**: 
  - `styles.css` (line 259): Changed from `color: white` to `color: var(--gray-800)`
  - `mobile.css` (line 6): Changed from `color: white` to `color: #1F2937`
  - Added `!important` overrides to ensure visibility

### 2. **Container Layout Issue**
- **Problem**: The navbar container was set to `flex-direction: column` on mobile, which stacked elements vertically and potentially pushed the hamburger menu out of view.
- **Fixed in**: `mobile.css` (line 91-95)
  - Changed to `flex-direction: row !important`
  - Added `justify-content: space-between !important`
  - Ensures logo and hamburger stay side-by-side

### 3. **Nav Brand Layout**
- **Problem**: Nav brand was set to column layout on mobile, taking up too much space.
- **Fixed in**: `mobile.css` (line 98-103)
  - Changed to `flex-direction: row`
  - Added `flex: 0 1 auto` to prevent excessive space usage

### 4. **Touch Target Size**
- **Problem**: Button might have been too small for mobile touch interaction.
- **Fixed in**: `mobile.css`
  - Added `min-width: 44px` and `min-height: 44px` (minimum touch target size)

### 5. **Material Icons Fallback**
- **Problem**: If Material Icons font fails to load, no menu icon would be visible.
- **Fixed in**: 
  - Added fallback span with ☰ character in HTML
  - Added CSS to show fallback when Material Icons fail

### 6. **Z-index and Positioning**
- **Added**: Higher z-index (1001) and relative positioning to ensure menu button stays on top
