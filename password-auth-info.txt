AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM UPDATE
===========================

Magic Link authentication has been disabled due to issues with email delivery and authentication loops.

The system now uses traditional password-based authentication:

1. LOGIN PAGE (/login.html)
   - Users enter email and password to sign in
   - Removed magic link option
   - Direct password authentication with Firebase

2. SIGNUP PAGE (/signup.html)
   - Users enter: Full Name, Email, Password, Confirm Password
   - Passwords must be at least 6 characters
   - Account is created immediately (no email verification needed)
   - User profile is created in Firestore
   - Auto-redirects to app after successful signup

3. REMOVED FILES
   - /auth.html (magic link handler) - deleted

4. KEY CHANGES
   - Firebase authDomain updated to "rasin.pyebwa.com" 
   - Removed all magic link related code
   - Simplified authentication flow
   - Fixed authentication state detection in app.js to wait for Firebase to load

5. AUTHENTICATION FLOW
   - User logs in with email/password
   - Session is persisted locally (Firebase.auth.Auth.Persistence.LOCAL)
   - App waits for auth state to be determined before redirecting
   - No more premature redirects to login page

This change provides a more reliable authentication experience without dependency on email delivery systems.
