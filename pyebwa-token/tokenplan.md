3. **Cultural Impact**: Preserve 100,000+ family memories in perpetuity
4. **Technical Excellence**: Build secure, scalable blockchain infrastructure

### Success Metrics
- 10,000 active diaspora families
- 1,000 verified tree planters
- 1 million trees planted and verified
- $100,000 in planter earnings
- 99.9% uptime
- < 2 second transaction confirmation
