# Project Plan: Fix EAS Build Errors

## Problem Statement
The EAS build was failing with two critical errors:
1. "Plugin [id: 'expo-module-gradle-plugin'] was not found" in expo-font
2. "Could not get unknown property 'release' for SoftwareComponent container" in expo-modules-core

## Root Causes
- Peer dependency conflicts in Expo SDK 52
- Compatibility issues between expo-modules-core and Gradle 8.10
- Version mismatches in the dependency tree

## Tasks Completed

### ✅ 1. Remove caret symbols (^) from all dependencies in package.json
- Removed all caret (^) symbols from dependencies to ensure exact versions
- Updated @babel/core from non-existent 7.20.0 to 7.25.2
- Updated typescript from 5.1.3 to 5.3.3

### ✅ 2. Add package overrides to package.json
Added overrides section with:
- expo-constants: ~15.4.6
- expo-linking: ~6.2.2
- expo-font: 13.0.4
- @expo/config-plugins: ~9.0.0

### ✅ 3. Update Kotlin version in app.json
- Updated kotlinVersion from "1.9.0" to "1.9.25" to match android/build.gradle

### ✅ 4. Clean build environment
- Removed node_modules directory
- Attempted to clear npm cache (had minor issues but continued)
- Reinstalled all dependencies with npm install

### ✅ 5. Run expo-doctor to check for compatibility
- Identified and fixed version mismatches for @babel/core and typescript
- Added override for @expo/config-plugins to resolve version conflict

## Review

### Changes Made
1. **package.json modifications**:
   - Removed all caret (^) symbols from dependencies for exact version locking
   - Added overrides section to force specific versions of problematic packages
   - Updated devDependencies to SDK 52 compatible versions

2. **app.json modification**:
   - Updated expo-build-properties kotlinVersion to match the project's gradle configuration

3. **Environment cleanup**:
   - Performed clean reinstall of all dependencies

### Impact
These changes specifically address the gradle plugin compatibility issues that were causing the EAS build to fail. By:
- Locking exact versions, we prevent version mismatch issues
- Using overrides, we force compatible versions of expo modules that have known issues in SDK 52
- Matching Kotlin versions ensures consistency across the build configuration

### Next Steps
1. Trigger a new EAS build to verify the fixes work
2. Monitor for any new gradle-related errors
3. If issues persist, consider:
   - Downgrading Gradle from 8.10.2 to 8.7.0
   - Temporarily removing expo-dev-client if not actively used
   - Waiting for Expo SDK 53 which reportedly includes the missing gradle plugin

### Notes
- expo-doctor still shows warnings about icon dimensions and unmaintained packages (react-native-crypto), but these are not related to the gradle build issues
- The New Architecture warnings can be addressed separately if needed
