## What Each Test Checks

1. **Device Detection** - Is your tablet correctly identified?
2. **Firebase Connection** - Can we connect to the backend?
3. **Cooldown Timer** - Is the 60-second cooldown working?
4. **Loop Detection** - Will loops be prevented?
5. **Storage** - Does data persist correctly?
6. **Authentication** - Can you login/logout?
7. **Performance** - Is the app fast enough?
8. **Network** - Does it handle connection issues?

## Common Issues & Solutions

### "Device Not Detected as Tablet"
- Try rotating device to landscape
- Check if desktop mode is enabled (disable it)
- Report device model for investigation

### "Authentication Test Failed"
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Try incognito/private mode
- Check network connection

### "Performance Test Failed"
- Close other apps/tabs
- Check available memory
- Try on faster network

## Manual Testing Scenarios

If automated tests pass, try these manual scenarios:

### 1. Rapid Login/Logout

4. Should work without loops

### 2. Multi-Tab Test
1. Open app in 3 browser tabs
2. Login in one tab

4. Logout from any tab
5. All tabs should logout

### 3. Network Interruption
1. Start login process
2. Turn off WiFi mid-login
3. Turn WiFi back on
4. Complete login
5. Should handle gracefully

## Reporting Issues

### What to Include:
1. Device model & OS version
2. Browser name & version
3. Test that failed
4. Screenshot of error
5. Exported test results file

### Where to Report:
- Create GitHub issue
- Include test results JSON
- Tag as "tablet-auth"
