### Search Index Structure
```javascript
// Firestore structure for search
familyTrees/{treeId}/searchIndex/{memberId} {
  // Tokenized search terms
  searchTerms: ['john', 'doe', 'johnny', '1950', 'new', 'york'],
  
  // Original data for filtering
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  nicknames: ['Johnny'],
  birthYear: 1950,
  deathYear: 2020,
  locations: ['New York', 'Boston'],
  
  // Phonetic codes
  firstNameSoundex: 'J500',
  lastNameSoundex: 'D000',
  
  // Relationships
  parentIds: [],
  childIds: [],
  spouseIds: [],
  
  // Metadata
  lastUpdated: timestamp
}
```
