# Phase 1 - Checkpoint 1.2: Performance Optimization

**Start Date:** January 11, 2025  
**Target Completion:** January 18, 2025 (1 week)

## Overview
With all technical debt resolved in Checkpoint 1.1, we now focus on optimizing performance across the application to ensure fast, responsive user experiences.

## Tasks

### ✅ Completed

#### 1. Site-wide Performance Monitoring
- [x] Implement performance monitoring system (`performance-monitor.js`)
- [x] Deploy to production and gather baseline metrics
- [ ] Create performance dashboard UI
- [ ] Set up alerts for performance degradation

#### 2. Firebase Query Optimization
- [x] Implement query caching system (`firebase-optimized.js`)
- [ ] Add composite indexes for common queries
- [ ] Implement pagination for large datasets
- [ ] Optimize real-time listeners

#### 3. Image Optimization
- [x] Implement lazy loading for all images (`lazy-load.js`)
- [x] Add WebP format support with fallbacks (`webp-support.js`)
- [ ] Create responsive image variants
- [ ] Implement progressive image loading

#### 4. Bundle Size Optimization
- [x] Analyze current bundle sizes (363.52 KB total, 88.41 KB gzipped)
- [ ] Implement code splitting
- [ ] Remove unused dependencies
- [ ] Minify and compress assets

#### 5. Caching Strategy
- [x] Implement service worker for offline support (`sw.js`)
- [ ] Set up proper HTTP caching headers
- [ ] Create cache invalidation strategy
- [ ] Implement prefetching for critical resources

## Implementation Details

### Performance Monitoring (Completed)
The `performance-monitor.js` script tracks:
- Page load times and Core Web Vitals
- API call performance
- Resource loading times
- User interactions

Access metrics: `window.pyebwaPerformance.getSummary()`

### Firebase Optimization (Completed)
The `firebase-optimized.js` script provides:
- Automatic query result caching (5-minute expiry)
- Request deduplication
- Batch operations support
- Optimized query helpers

Usage:
```javascript
// Use optimized queries
const members = await pyebwaQueries.getFamilyMembers(treeId, lastDoc, 20);
const searchResults = await pyebwaQueries.searchMembers(treeId, 'John');

// Use batch operations
pyebwaBatch.add({
    type: 'update',
    ref: docRef,
    data: { field: value }
});
```

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Page load time < 3 seconds on 3G
- [ ] Time to Interactive < 5 seconds
- [ ] First Contentful Paint < 1.5 seconds
- [ ] Cumulative Layout Shift < 0.1
- [x] Firebase query response time < 500ms (cached) ✅
- [x] Bundle size analyzed: 363.52 KB (88.41 KB gzipped) ✅

## Next Steps
After completing performance optimization, we'll move to:
- Checkpoint 1.3: Security Audit
- Checkpoint 1.4: Testing Framework
- Checkpoint 1.5: Documentation

## Notes
- Performance monitoring is now active in production
- Firebase caching is transparent to existing code
- Focus on mobile performance as priority
