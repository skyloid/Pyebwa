# Authentication Fixed - Single Domain Solution

## What Was Fixed

### Problem
- Authentication redirect loop between pyebwa.com and rasin.pyebwa.com
- Cross-domain token issues
- Login page was returning 404 on rasin.pyebwa.com

### Solution Implemented

1. **Server Configuration Updated**
   - Modified `server.js` to serve `login.html` at `/login.html`
   - Added route for the login page in Express server
   - Server now properly handles authentication pages

2. **App.js Updated**
   - Changed redirect from `https://pyebwa.com/simple-login.html` to `/login.html`
   - All authentication now happens on single domain (rasin.pyebwa.com)

3. **File Permissions Fixed**
   - Changed login.html permissions from 660 to 644
   - Made file readable by web server

## Current Authentication Flow

1. User visits pyebwa.com
2. Clicks login → redirected to https://rasin.pyebwa.com/login.html
3. Logs in with Firebase (stays on rasin.pyebwa.com)
4. After successful login → redirected to https://rasin.pyebwa.com/app/
5. All authentication happens on single domain - no more cross-domain issues!

## Files Modified

- `/home/pyebwa-rasin/htdocs/rasin.pyebwa.com/server.js` - Added login.html route
- `/home/pyebwa-rasin/htdocs/rasin.pyebwa.com/app/js/app.js` - Updated redirect to local login
- `/home/pyebwa-rasin/htdocs/rasin.pyebwa.com/login.html` - Fixed file permissions

## Test the Fix

Visit: https://rasin.pyebwa.com/test-auth-flow-final.html

Or manually test:
1. Clear browser cache/cookies
2. Visit https://rasin.pyebwa.com/app/
3. You should be redirected to https://rasin.pyebwa.com/login.html
4. After login, you'll be back at https://rasin.pyebwa.com/app/

## No More Loops!

The authentication system now works entirely on rasin.pyebwa.com, eliminating all cross-domain redirect loops and token sharing issues.
