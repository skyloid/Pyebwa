# Forgot Password Feature Implementation

## Overview
A secure "forgot password" feature has been added to the login page at https://rasin.pyebwa.com/login.html

## Security Features

### 1. No User Enumeration
- When an email doesn't exist, the system displays: "If an account exists with this email, you will receive a password reset link."
- This prevents attackers from discovering which emails have accounts
- Same UI behavior whether the email exists or not (form clears, modal closes after 3 seconds)

### 2. Firebase Built-in Security
- Uses Firebase Authentication's `sendPasswordResetEmail()` method
- Firebase handles:
  - Secure token generation
  - Token expiration (default: 1 hour)
  - Rate limiting (prevents brute force attacks)
  - Email verification

### 3. No Password Information Leaked
- No password hints
- No password strength indicators during reset
- No information about account status

### 4. Rate Limiting
- Firebase automatically rate-limits password reset requests
- Shows "Too many requests. Please try again later." when limit is hit

## User Experience

### 1. Easy Access
- "Forgot password?" link positioned below the password field
- Link styled in primary blue color for visibility

### 2. Modal Dialog
- Clean, modern modal design matching the login page
- Smooth animations (fade in overlay, slide up content)

### 3. Smart Email Pre-filling
- If user already entered email in login form, it's pre-filled in the reset form
- Saves user time and reduces errors

### 4. Clear Feedback
- Success: "Password reset link sent! Check your email inbox."
- Invalid email: "Please enter a valid email address."
- Network error: "Network error. Please check your connection and try again."
- Rate limiting: "Too many requests. Please try again later."

### 5. Auto-close on Success
- Modal automatically closes after 3 seconds on successful submission
- Gives user time to read the success message

### 6. Keyboard Support
- Escape key closes the modal
- Tab navigation works properly
- Form can be submitted with Enter key

### 7. Click Outside to Close
- Clicking the dark overlay closes the modal
- Standard UX pattern users expect

## Technical Implementation

### HTML Structure
```html
<!-- Forgot password link -->
<a href="#" class="forgot-password-link" onclick="showForgotPassword(); return false;">
    Forgot password?
</a>

<!-- Modal -->
<div class="modal-overlay" id="forgotPasswordModal">
    <div class="modal-content">
        <!-- Modal content -->
    </div>
</div>
```

### JavaScript Functions
- `showForgotPassword()` - Opens modal, pre-fills email
- `hideForgotPassword()` - Closes modal, clears form
- Form submission handler with async/await
- Event listeners for click-outside and Escape key

### CSS Styling
- Modal with semi-transparent overlay
- Smooth animations (fadeIn, slideUp)
- Responsive design (90% width on mobile)
- Consistent with login page design

## Email Reset Flow

1. User clicks "Forgot password?" link
2. Modal opens with email input
3. User enters email and submits
4. Firebase sends reset email
5. User receives email with secure link
6. Clicking link takes user to Firebase-hosted password reset page
7. User enters new password
8. User is redirected back to login page
9. User can now login with new password

## Firebase Console Configuration

To customize the password reset email:
1. Go to Firebase Console > Authentication > Templates
2. Click on "Password reset"
3. Customize the email subject, sender name, and message
4. The reset link is automatically included by Firebase

## Testing

1. Visit https://rasin.pyebwa.com/login.html
2. Click "Forgot password?" link
3. Enter a registered email
4. Check email for reset link
5. Follow link to reset password
6. Try logging in with new password

## Files Modified
- `/login.html` - Added forgot password link, modal, CSS, and JavaScript

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
1. Custom password reset page (instead of Firebase default)
2. Email template customization
3. Password strength requirements on reset page
4. Multi-language support for reset emails
