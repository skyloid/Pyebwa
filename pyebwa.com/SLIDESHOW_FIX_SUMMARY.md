# Slideshow Fix Summary

## Issue Found
The slideshow disappeared because of a CSS class mismatch:
- The HTML was using class `forest-slideshow`
- The CSS file (styles.css) was expecting class `slideshow-container`

## Solution Applied
Changed line 515 in mission.html from:
```html
<div class="forest-slideshow">
```
to:
```html
<div class="slideshow-container">
```

## Test Files Created
1. **slideshow-debug.html** - Comprehensive debug test with console logging
2. **slideshow-test-minimal.html** - Minimal working example
3. **mission-slideshow-fix.html** - Full fixed version of mission page

## Verification Steps
1. The images are accessible (verified with curl)
2. The HTML structure is intact
3. The JavaScript slideshow code is properly implemented
4. The CSS now correctly targets the slideshow container

## Additional Notes
- The slideshow uses 5 tropical/Caribbean forest images from Unsplash
- Images transition every 5 seconds with a 2-second fade
- First slide is set to active by default
- The slideshow pauses when the browser tab is hidden to save resources

The slideshow should now be working properly on the mission page!
