# Login Loop Fix Summary

## Issue Identified

The login loop was caused by incorrect redirect logic in `/app/js/app.js` at line 189. When a user wasn't authenticated, the app redirected to `www.pyebwa.com` instead of the login page at `secure.pyebwa.com`, creating an infinite redirect loop.

## Root Cause

### The Loop Pattern:
1. User visits `rasin.pyebwa.com/app` (not logged in)
2. App redirects to `www.pyebwa.com` (line 189)
3. `www.pyebwa.com` redirects to `secure.pyebwa.com` for login
4. After login, redirects back through `www.pyebwa.com` to `rasin.pyebwa.com/app`
5. If auth state hasn't synced yet, app thinks user isn't logged in
6. **Loop restarts** at step 2

## Fix Applied

### 1. Primary Fix (Line 189)
Changed:
```javascript
window.location.href = 'https://www.pyebwa.com';
```

To:
```javascript
window.location.href = 'https://secure.pyebwa.com/?redirect=' + encodeURIComponent(window.location.href);
```

This ensures unauthenticated users go directly to the login page, preventing the loop.

### 2. Timing Improvements
- Increased max auth checks from 10 to 20
- Increased check interval from 1 second to 1.5 seconds
- Increased initial wait time from 2 seconds to 3 seconds

This gives Firebase more time to synchronize authentication state across domains.

## Files Modified

1. `/app/js/app.js` - Fixed redirect logic and improved timing

## Testing Tools Created

1. **`diagnose-login-loop.html`** - Comprehensive diagnostic tool to:
   - Check current auth state
   - Monitor redirect parameters
   - Test authentication flow
   - View storage state

2. **`test-login-fix.html`** - Quick test tool to verify the fix

## How to Verify the Fix

1. **Clear all browser data** (cookies, localStorage, sessionStorage)
2. **Visit** `rasin.pyebwa.com/app`
3. **Expected behavior**:
   - Redirects to `secure.pyebwa.com` for login
   - After successful login, redirects back to `rasin.pyebwa.com/app`
   - User stays logged in without any loops

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. Implement Token-Based Auth
Pass the Firebase ID token in the URL to enable immediate authentication:

```javascript
// In secure-app.js
const idToken = await user.getIdToken();
window.location.href = redirectUrl + '&token=' + encodeURIComponent(idToken);

// In app.js
const token = urlParams.get('token');
if (token) {
    await auth.signInWithCustomToken(token);
}
```

### 2. Add Auth State Persistence
Ensure auth persists across domains:

```javascript
await auth.setPersistence(firebase.auth.Auth.Persistence.LOCAL);
```

### 3. Implement Auth Bridge
Use the existing `auth-relay.html` more effectively for cross-domain auth synchronization.

## Debug Information

If issues persist, check:
1. Browser console for errors
2. `localStorage.pyebwaDebugLogs` for auth flow logs
3. Network tab for redirect chains
4. Firebase console for auth errors

## Status

âœ… **Fix has been applied and is ready for testing**

The main cause of the login loop has been addressed. Users should now be able to log in and access the application without experiencing infinite redirects.
